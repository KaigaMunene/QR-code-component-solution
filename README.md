## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - lets you run automated builds of your website with each Git commit using CI/CD pipeline designed for web developers

### What I learned

- Learn't how to deploy my project to netlify for the first time. 
- Found it easier to start with mobile first approach and then create desktop next, it made it easier when it came to the responsiveness part.

### Continued development
- Host more projects to netlify and other deploying sites
